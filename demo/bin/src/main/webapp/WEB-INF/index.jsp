<h3>Bulls and Cows is a 2 player game. One player thinks of a number,
     while the other player tries to guess it.</h3>
<h4> ¡Ü The number to be guessed must be a 3 digit number, 
    using only digits from 1 - 9, each digit atmost once. 
    <br>e.g. 123 is valid, 012 is not valid, 988 is not valid, 987 is valid.</h4>
<h4> ¡Ü For every guess that the player makes, 
    he gets 2 values - the number of bulls and the number of cows. 
    1 bull means the guess contains and the target number have 1 digit in common, 
    and in the correct position. 
    1 cow means the guess and the target have 1 digit in common,
     but not in correct position.
    <br> e.g. Let the target be 123. 
    Guessing 312 will give 0 bulls and 3 cows. 
    321 will give 1 bull and 2 cows. 3 bulls means you have won the game! </h4>
